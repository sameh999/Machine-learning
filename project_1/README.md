# Machine-learning

## Goal :

Our goal is to build model give me high performance and accuracy and make enhance to the model
by using more than 1 algorism and make aggregation to the prediction and to improve the model

## Dataset :

1. The data is coming cleaned and was made a process on it and the data suitable to
   word with it directly with model.
2. Dataset is already divided into the training and testing and that helps to could make
   detection the data belong to class ( 1,2,3) ((Kama, Rosa and Canadian))

## Represent data to see the feature and lapels

## SVM Mode

Output is :The accuracy of the model is 100% that maens the model is
predicted all values correctly.

## Perceptron Model:

we work on the perceptron to get the accuracy of the model to make
classification in class 2,3 (Rosa and Canadian) the model give us accuracy
83%

## OVR SVM:

Made binarize labels for Train labels and Test labels by using binarizedlabels
function that Obtain the binarized labels.1 for positive class, -1 for negative class (OvR)

## OVR SVM:

Made binarize labels for Train labels and Test labels by using binarizedlabels
function that Obtain the binarized labels.1 for positive class, -1 for negative class (OvR)

## Using Argmax for Aggregation:
