## G 5255 Applied Machine Learning Fall 2021

### Assignment 2 (Bayesian Decision)

### Submission

You must submit your assignment on-line with Bright Space. This is the only method by which we
accept assignment submissions. We do not accept assignments sent via email, and we are not
able to enter a mark if the assignment is not submitted on Bright Space! The deadline date is firm
since you cannot submit a assignment passed the deadline. It is student's responsibility to ensure
that the assignment has been submitted properly. A mark of 0 will be assigned to any missing
assignment.

### Goal

This assignment aims to understand Na誰ve Bayes Classification and implement Risk-based
Bayesian Decision Theory Classifier.

### Dataset

During this assignment, the well-known Iris flower dataset is used.
Iris dataset contains 150 samples, 4 features (i.e., sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal
width), and 3 classes (i.e., Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolour, Iris-Virginica).
The dataset is already available in sklearn lib; therefore the following code can help you load the
dataset

### Part 1

Given the training data in Table 1 (from Iris dataset), predict the class of of following examples in
Table 2 using Na誰ve Bayes Classification (assume each feature has normal distribution). (Please
note that you must answer the following questions and show your calculation process and the
formulas you use. You won't receive marks if you only provide answers.)
Q1: Calculate mean value of each class of each feature in Table 1 (5 marks)
Q2: Calculate variance of each class of each feature in Table 1 (5 marks)
Q3: Calculate the posterior probabilities for each sample for each class in Table 2 and predict
classes (10 marks)

### Part 2

Please note the difference among Iris dataset (with 4 features and 3 classes), 2D Iris dataset (with
2 features and 3 classes) which is obtained by dropping the last 2 features (i.e., petal length and
petal width) and keep Sepal length and Sepal width.
Please submit your code and report (including screen shot of code and the relevant figures).

1. Load Iris Dataset
   Please set random_state ad 0
   from sklearn import datasets
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   iris = datasets.load_iris()
   X, y = iris.data, iris.target
   trX, teX, trY, teY = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)
   1 2 3 4 5
2. Drop the petal length and petal width features to form a 2D Iris dataset
3. Apply Na誰ve Bayes Classifier to get training and testing accuracy (10 marks)
4. Tune hyperparameters of Naive Bayes Classifier (i.e., var_smoothing). Try var_smoothing as
   1e-9, 1e-8, 1e-7. Plot accuracy vs var_smoothing curve for training and testing set. (10 marks)
5. Develop Risk-based Bayesian Decision Theory Classifier (RBDTC)
   Please refer the lecture slides ELG5255EG00_Lecture3_Fall21 for detailed explanation
   The classifier must inherit BaseEstimator and ClassifierMinxin in sklearn. Please check
   the link for detailed information about developing
   The classifier should check inputs and model status as other well defined models in
   sklearn
   Implement **init** function in proper way. **init** should be able to take risk
   matrix and any kind of base estimator as inputs (5 marks)
   Implement fit function in proper way. fit should be able to take training dataset (X
   and y) as input. In this function the base estimator should be trained while original base
   estimator should not be changed (5 marks)
   Implement predict_proba function. predict_proba should only take testing X as
   input. The output of predict_proba should be a matrix , where is the number
   of testing samples and is the number of classes. The element of each element in the
   matrix , where is the sample in testing set, is
   the class, is the row and element in risk matrix. The element of output
   matrix does not have to be scaled to 0~1. Use no more than one loop (5 marks)
   Implement predict function in proper way. predict should be able to output text
   format y (5 marks)

6. Apply Risk-based Bayesian Decision Theory Classifier which takes Na誰ve Bayes Classifier as
   base estimator and uses Table 3 as risk matrix (10 marks)
7. Plot decision boundary and calculate precision, recall and accuracy for training and testing
   set (10 marks)
8. Compare and analysis the performance between NB and RBDTC regarding to their decision
   boundary, precision, recall, and accuracy(10 marks)
9. Provide a conclusion section on your report. Include overview of what you have done and
   learnt during the assignment. Aim no less than one third of a page and no more than half
   page. (10 Marks)
